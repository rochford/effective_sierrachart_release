## Disclaimer

This tool and material is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered a
solicitation to buy or sell a futures contract or make any other type of investment decision. Futures
trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or
more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones
financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient
risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

CFTC Rules 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have certain limitations, unlike an
actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have
not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain
market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the
fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any
account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown
