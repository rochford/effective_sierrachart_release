CFTC Rules 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have certain limitations, unlike an
actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have
not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain
market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the
fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any
account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown
